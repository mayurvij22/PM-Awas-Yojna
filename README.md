The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) project is an initiative by the Government of India aimed at providing affordable housing to the urban poor. Creating a Java project using JSP, Java, MySQL, and JDBC to simulate or manage this scheme can be an excellent way to demonstrate practical skills in web development and database management. Below is a detailed project description for your reference:
Project Title

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) Housing Management System
Project Description

The PMAY Housing Management System is a web-based application designed to manage the processes involved in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana scheme. The application enables users to apply for housing, check the status of their applications, and manage housing allotments. Administrators can oversee and manage applications, verify eligibility, and allocate houses to beneficiaries.

        Users can register with personal details.
        Secure login using username and password.

    Application Submission:
        Users can apply for housing by filling out an application form.
        Form includes details such as personal information, income, and other eligibility criteria.

    Application Status Tracking:
        Users can track the status of their application.
        Notifications on the progress and outcome of the application.

    Admin Dashboard:
        Admin login to manage the housing scheme.
        View, verify, and approve/reject applications.
        Allocate houses to approved beneficiaries.

    Database Management:
        Store user information, application details, and allocation records in a MySQL database.
        Secure and efficient data handling using JDBC.

Technologies Used

    Java: Core logic and business operations.
    JSP (JavaServer Pages): For creating dynamic web content.
    MySQL: Database management system to store application data.
    JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): To connect and interact with the MySQL database.

System Architecture

    Frontend:
        HTML/CSS for basic web design.
        JSP for dynamic content rendering.

    Backend:
        Java Servlets to handle requests and responses.
        Business logic implemented in Java classes.

    Database:
        MySQL to store user data, application details, and allocation records.
        JDBC for database operations (CRUD).
